## Project structure

- **Monorepo**: The repository is a single workspace containing multiple packages.
- **Namespaces**:
  - `apps/`: runnable applications (web servers, CLIs, workers, etc.).
  - `services/`: domain-specific logic and service modules, typically consumed by apps.
  - `packages/`: generic, reusable libraries with no domain/app coupling.

### Application structure

- `app/`: route pages and page-scoped components
  - `app/<route>/page.tsx`: page file for the route `<route>`
  - `app/<route>/_components/`: components scoped to that page/route only
- App-specific logic folders:
  - `config/`: runtime/environment configuration and app-wide settings
  - `hooks/`: shared React hooks used across pages/components
  - `lib/`: utilities, clients, and helpers (not page-specific)
  - `types/`: shared TypeScript types and interfaces

## Import boundaries

- **apps**: can import from `services` and `packages`.
- **services**: can import from other `services` and `packages`.
- **packages**: can import only from other `packages`.

Do not introduce imports that violate these boundaries. All imports are via the `@botfi/*` scope; app packages end with `-app`.

## Package manager

- **pnpm** is the package manager for this monorepo.
- Prefer running commands from the target package directory.
- Examples:
  - Install deps in an app: `cd apps/<app-name> && pnpm install`
  - Run dev server: `cd apps/<app-name> && pnpm dev`
  - Build a service: `cd services/<service-name> && pnpm build`
  - Use filters from the root when needed: `pnpm --filter <package-name> run build`

## Running applications

- Always `cd` into the specific app directory before running it.
- Common commands (run inside the app folder):
  - `pnpm dev` for development
  - `pnpm start` for production start
  - `CI=1 pnpm test:unit` for unit testing
  - `CI=1 pnpm test:it` for integration testing
